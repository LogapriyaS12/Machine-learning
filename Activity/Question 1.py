'''1. Analyzing Student Performance:  
Scenario: You are analyzing factors that affect student performance in a standardized test. You collect data on study hours, attendance rates, and socioeconomic background.  
Question: How would you set up your linear regression model? What considerations would you make regarding the interpretation of coefficients in this context?'''

'''4. Financial Investment Decisions  
Scenario: An investment firm uses a decision tree to analyze potential investment opportunities based on market trends and economic indicators.  
Question: What process would you follow to update the decision tree as market conditions change? How would you visualize these changes for clarity among team members?'''
